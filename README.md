# COSC314-HW1-SimpleTruthTable
The first program of my COSC314 class.

In this program I calculate the values of the most basic expressions in truth tables like....
      AND
      OR
      XOR
      CONDITIONAL
      BICONDITIONAL
      
I do this by replacing the "True" and "False" values with 1s and 0s respectively

I then apply simple addition to figure out what value goes in which expression
    
    For example if P and Q are equal to 2, then I know that P = 1 and Q = 1....
